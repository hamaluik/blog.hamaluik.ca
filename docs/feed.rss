In doing this, we run into far more inexperienced users than traditional VR games do. Most of the people using our tools and applications have never experienced virtual reality first hand. Ultimately, this means that a significant amount of our target audience has based their entire digital experience expectations on the interactions they've grown accustomed to on their phones, tablets, and workstations—namely 2D interactions on a 2D screen with 2D objects. Overcoming the tendency to think of and interact with digital spaces as two-dimensional rather than three-dimensional is VR's great power, however it comes with a cost—upending 30 years of 2D zeitgeist is no easy task.]]></description><author>kenton@hamaluik.ca (Kenton Hamaluik)</author><guid>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/vr-ux-case-study-tilt-brush/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2017 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Getting Started With Haxe Macros</title><link>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/getting-started-with-haxe-macros/</link><description><![CDATA[Like has been said many times before, Haxe macros are incredibly powerful. They don't always have the best documentation however, and I find a lot of people forgo their use entirely (instead doing things such as creating nodejs scripts to copy files around for building). Hopefully I can help shed some light on how to build your own macros for those who are new to the language, or macros in general. I'll cover three macros I use on a regular basis, one each of the three types listed in the manual: an initialization macro for copying files to the build folder; a build macro for providing easy auto-completion of asset filenames (a la HaxeFlixel's AssetPaths); and an expression macro for grabbing the build date as a Date object.]]></description><author>kenton@hamaluik.ca (Kenton Hamaluik)</author><guid>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/getting-started-with-haxe-macros/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2016 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Dynamic Blender Properties</title><link>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/dynamic-blender-properties/</link><description><![CDATA[As part of my most recent adventures in game engine programming, I came across a small problem—I needed a way to edit levels (both their geometry, and the entities within the level and their associated components). Writing an editor to do this is a rather daunting task. Thankfully, Blender is a free, open-source 3D application that is 'easily' extended (well, easy-ish). So, instead of writing my own editor, I can write a Blender addon to make it do what I need it to. First up in that, was presenting an interface for editing which components an object has, and setting the values of each components' attributes. I found this to be more difficult that I expected, thanks to the way Blender handles and presents data. I will show you here how I got things working, as there doesn't seem to be documentation on this and I had to wade through a lot of half-expired forum posts to get things working.]]></description><author>kenton@hamaluik.ca (Kenton Hamaluik)</author><guid>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/dynamic-blender-properties/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2016 19:58:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Quaternions as Four-Dimensional Complex Numbers</title><link>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/quaternions-as-four-dimensional-complex-numbers/</link><description><![CDATA[Although I have a pretty solid background in math (especially vectors, matrices, and even tensors), I've always somewhat struggled with quaternions. Most sources focus on quaternions as some tool for performing rotations in three-dimensions while avoiding gimbal lock. Which is true, they are/ that, but they're also more. After reading several articles about quaternions over the past several days, quaternions finally clicked and made sense!

Macros are undoubtedly the most advanced feature of Haxe and probably the hardest to grasp, however I think a major reason for that is a lack of really solid documentation on the subject. To me, the Haxe docs regarding macros are somewhat obfuscated and leave something to be desired, and unfortunately there’s not a lot of other resources online. This is what led me to embark on my own journey of learning Haxe macros, and hopefully starting to shed a little more light on their mystery.]]></description><author>kenton@hamaluik.ca (Kenton Hamaluik)</author><guid>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/creating-a-code-profiler-in-haxe-using-macros/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2015 05:21:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>A Unity 4.6 UI Shader to Ignore Depth Testing</title><link>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/a-unity-4.6-ui-shader-to-ignore-depth-testing/</link><description><![CDATA[I’ve started using Unity again for some 3D development with Google Cardboard and have been using the new Unity 4.6 UI (which I think is great by the way). Specifically, in order to get UIs rendered for the user in the 3D environment, I needed to place text on a canvas set to World Space (parenting the canvas to the camera, so that it tracks with the user’s head motion). This places the UI in a physical space, which works well for the 3D view but doesn’t work well for a HUD where you need it to always be displayed over everything.]]></description><author>kenton@hamaluik.ca (Kenton Hamaluik)</author><guid>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/a-unity-4.6-ui-shader-to-ignore-depth-testing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2015 01:16:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>A Platform Agnostic Thread Pool for Haxe / OpenFL</title><link>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/a-platform-agnostic-thread-pool-for-haxe-openfl/</link><description><![CDATA[With modern hardware utilizing multiple cores, it can be highly advantageous to do as much parallel processing as possible. I think the most elegant way of doing this is to use thread pools which allocate tasks to a limited number of threads.

Continuous collision detection is essential in any game where you have fast-moving objects and/or low frame rates. It adds slightly more complexity to the discrete collision detection algorithm, but the advantages far outweigh the costs in this case!]]></description><author>kenton@hamaluik.ca (Kenton Hamaluik)</author><guid>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/swept-aabb-collision-using-minkowski-difference/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2014 23:47:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Simple AABB Collision Detection Using the Minkowski Difference</title><link>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/simple-aabb-collision-using-minkowski-difference/</link><description><![CDATA[Since I’ve started on an adventure to start creating my games with Haxe and OpenFL, I found myself in need of some collision detection. I don’t really need anything as fancy or extensive as Nape, and although the HxCollision library is a pretty solid Separating Axis Theorem implementation, it doesn’t deal with swept-collisions, which is a bit of an issue for games (without swept collisions, any lag spikes can easily cause objects to pass right through objects!).]]></description><author>kenton@hamaluik.ca (Kenton Hamaluik)</author><guid>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/simple-aabb-collision-using-minkowski-difference/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2014 23:47:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Better Beamer Themes</title><link>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/better-beamer-themes/</link><description><![CDATA[I love LaTeX for typesetting all my documents.

This sometimes becomes an issue for me when I work on games as while I can make the game technically sound, the art is often downright horrible, or I spend way more time on it than I have any right to. I'm currently working on a long-term, back-burner type game project to keep me busy and distracted when I occasionally need a break from real life. Programming-wise, I'm fine, but what's a game without art? Well, aside from Dwarf Fortress and most Roguelikes out there, it's not much.

After digging through the math, I came up with these results which I'll share for the simplicity of it all (they really are simpler than I ever though). I found most sources started at the beginning and gave huge mathematical backgrounds, which although are nice, are typically just not what I was looking for.

Combine this with custom Java annotations, and you get a very easy way to write a scriptable interface for a program for example.]]></description><author>kenton@hamaluik.ca (Kenton Hamaluik)</author><guid>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/auto-detecting-certain-methods-injava/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2012 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Solving Equations Using the Newton-Raphson Method</title><link>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/solving-equations-using-the-newton-raphson-method/</link><description><![CDATA[Computers are great, but as it turns out—they're not always the smartest of folks. However, they are great at doing simple math! Today, I'll show you how to exploit these silicon monsters to do something that sometimes humans even fail at: solving a simple non-linear equation.]]></description><author>kenton@hamaluik.ca (Kenton Hamaluik)</author><guid>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/solving-equations-using-the-newton-raphson-method/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2011 21:50:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Solving Systems of Partial Differential Equations</title><link>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/solving-systems-of-partial-differential-equations/</link><description><![CDATA[Systems of partial differential equations crop up all the time in engineering, especially when examining real-world complicated problems that vary in time (such as a ballistic trajectory with drag forces non-negligable), or in various process control systems (ex: relating flow conditions in systems of tanks with the height in those tanks).]]></description><author>kenton@hamaluik.ca (Kenton Hamaluik)</author><guid>https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/solving-systems-of-partial-differential-equations/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2011 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
